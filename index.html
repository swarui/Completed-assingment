<p1>How does writing CSS differ from writing HTML?</p1>
</div>

  <p>As we write CSS these are the type of questions we might ask ourselves</p>
  <div class="perspective-questions">
  <div>
    <ul>
      <li>Should we layout the text in a single or double column?</li>
      <li>Should we use a different font colour for the header?</li>
      <li>How should the very same content appear differently on a desktop vs.a mobile device?</li></div>
    </ul>
<div>
  <div class="myx">
 <p> All of the questions above deal with esthetic and function considerations.These are the perspectives of the presentational layer(CSS)</p>
 As a contrast Let's consider the type of questions we might ask ourselves as we write HTML:
</div>
<ul>
  <li>Does the order of items within a list matter? Should it be anumbered list?</li>
  <li>Should we wrap a list of list of links inside a navigation tag?</li>
  <li>Is this the most important header in the whole HTML documents?</li>
</ul>
<div class="myx">
<p> The last few questions deal with the structure, hierachy, and meaning. These are the perspectives of the content layer (HTML)</p>
<p>When we write CSS we focus on esthetic and function considerations. When we write HTML we focus on the structure,hierachy, and meaning.</p>
